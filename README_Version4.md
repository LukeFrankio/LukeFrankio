## about me (no cap fr fr)

uwu hai!! i'm a student who's absolutely **feral** about:
- **AI** (yes including AI art, it's a tool and tools are morally neutral)
- **procedural generation** (making infinity go brrrr)
- **SDFs & fractals** (geometry but make it spicy)
- **abstract math** (touch grass? nah, touch manifolds)
- **space & string theory** (11 dimensions or bust)
- **lambda calculus** (functions within functions within functions...)

## my political stance
extremely left-leaning. eat the rich. mutual aid > capitalism. trans rights are human rights. no ethical consumption under late-stage capitalism but we do our best uwu

## tech stack (the good stuff only)

### languages i stan:
```cpp
// uwu the only real systems language
std::vector<std::string> loves = {"C++", "Python", "R", "Malbolge"};
```

### tools that slap:
- **CMake** - the build system that actually makes sense (fight me)
- **GCC** - compiler supremacy, no notes
- **Vulkan** - graphics API for people with taste
- **Doxygen** - because commenting code is self-care

### what i DON'T vibe with:
- **Rust** - memory safety? more like memory *cringe* (jk but also not jk)
- **OOP** - objects are fake, functions are forever
- **Proprietary software** - information wants to be free bestie

## projects that go hard

### [pongcpp](https://github.com/LukeFrankio/pongcpp)
**path traced pong on the CPU** because why use the GPU when you can make your processor cry? 

features that make it iconic:
- full ray tracing on CPU (masochism but make it art)
- physically accurate lighting (for PONG)

## learning everything

Currently diving deep into literally everything that catches my interest:
- **SDF rendering techniques** (making spheres march like it's their JOB)
- **quantum field theory** (physics but make it incomprehensible)
- **category theory** (math so abstract it hurts)
- **procedural generation algorithms** (more chaos, always more chaos)
- **AI/ML techniques** (neural networks go brrr)
- **advanced lambda calculus** (Y combinators my beloved)

## philosophy corner

> "why write object-oriented code when you could write **CORRECT** code?" - me, a functional programming warrior

i genuinely believe:
- code should be excessively commented (future you will thank present you)
- open source is praxis
- accessibility matters in tech
- functional > imperative (pure functions or perish)
- everyone should learn lambda calculus (it's just neat)
- AI art is a tool like any other (the ethics are in how we use it, not the tool itself)

## fun facts

- i unironically write **Malbolge** (yes, i'm okay, no, i don't need help)
- i think **CMake** is beautiful (this is a cry for help)
- i've memorized more lambda calculus than i've memorized people's names
- **Vulkan** makes me feel alive (the pain is worth it)
- my actual code documentation is surprisingly professional despite everything else about me

### remember: there is no ethical consumption under capitalism but there IS ethical code under GPL uwu

**functional programming gang rise up**
